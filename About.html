            I believe that web development is a great career path for me personally
             because I am a total geek! I love everything to do with IT and web and enjoy learning new things in the domain.
             Another reason I chose to study it is how much I enjoy being creative and turning creative thoughts,
             ideas and concepts into marvelous things that can help people with their day to day,
            to help improve their lives or even to just simplify their tasks so they have more time for themselves!
